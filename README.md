# Code:You Data Project


## Hey team!

**We are working on this project as a team so:**



* No one should take on everything
* we can not work on the main branch!
* We need to communicate with each other often!
* we will use GitHub Projects
* If you need to add a card let a project manager know and they will add it.
* We will have all of our code reviewed before doing a PR
* All code should have tests to verify it works as intended
* All code should be in functions

<br>
**Final Report Code** will live in a google collab Notebook
    * It will have a input data folder
    * The script will run
    * Then export the data needed into an output folder
<br>
<br>
**certificate generator** - (pending the template and finished example)
    * will take a spreadsheet with names and other needed info
    * Determine values needed to do the following
    * place them on the provided template
    * saves it to a folder with a name that is unique
    * Then emails it to the student


## Deliverables



* Key metrics of the program including but not limited to: completion rate, demographics etc
* Any advanced data science is welcome, for example deep correlation study of factors for graduation
* A dashboard of our findings via - google looker
* A certificate generator
